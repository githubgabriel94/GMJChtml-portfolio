    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I'll quickly introduce myself. I'm a software engineer, web developer, multi-platform developer, low-code developer, front-end developer... I'm whatever you need me to be, because what I truly am, is a passionate individual who loves technology of both the software and the hardware kind, a lover of good design language, intuitive UI's, good/fast user experiences and especially, someone with a lot of desire to demonstrate how much I'm worth. That cannot be taught, that cannot be changed, it's simply part of who I am. What can be changed is how unimpressive my resume may look (hope it doesn't but just in case), or how I may not have the experience on coding in a certain platform with a certain language. Our industry is filled with IDE's, coding languages, platforms, tools, etc. and it's near impossible to dominate them all, but what I can ensure is a capacity to learn anything required to fulfil whatever this job asks of me, if not more.

        <p>Also, I'm from Spain (Greencard holder living in VA) and even though I'm not Jose Andres, I can make a mean paella.

    <h2>Education</h2>
        <ol>
            <h3><li>Liberty High School</li></h3>
            <p>Just arrived from Spain to the United States I completed the last two years of High School here, in Frisco (TX) before graduating in 2012 with 18 years of age.</p>
            <h3><li>Colin Community College</li></h3>
            <p>Finding myself wondering what exactly I wanted to do with my life and being quite new to the United States at the time, I found the Community College option to be a good one. During this time I completed the so called Texas Core of classes which encompasses a range of disciplines and credits mandatory to all degrees in the state of Texas. In the meantime I would take classes that belonged to the first year of different batchelor's. All and all I ended up exploring fields like entrepreneurship, periodisim and civil law. Ultimately I decided not to continue with any of them as, unexpectedly I found my path elsewhere.</p>
            <p>When looking back at this time period (2012-2016), it is true that I came away with no title's, nothing to show for on paper as they say. But the truth is that I came out of that time with so much more than what a Batchelor's degree on anything can provide you with. I came out of this four year gap with a much better notion of not only who I was, but who I wanted to be as well. One of my favorite lines of all time is the following by the great Thomas Edison, "I have not failed, I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work". And I think it could not better encompass the journey I experience during this four years and what I got out of it.</p>
            <h3><li>Pontifical University of Salamanca (UPSA)</li></h3>
            <p>With all now figured out and the motivation that comes with that, all I needed to do during this period was to put in the necessary work. Said work granted me the Batchelor's Degree on Computer Science and Engineering on June of 2021.</p>
